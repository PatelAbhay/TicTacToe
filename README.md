# Tic Tac Toe

[Demo](https://patelabhay.github.io/TicTacToe/)

## About
This is my first ever React project where I created a two player version of Tic-Tac-Toe. There is also the 
option for single player mode where the User can go up against a Computer. This was done by implementing
the Minimax algorithm along with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
